♻️Green Campus Waste Mismanagement System♻️

Hello guys! This is an AI-trained model which is designed to identify the type of waste that is being shown to the device and give appropriate instructions about its disposal(plus an additional fact!). It aims to promote responsible waste segregation and sustainability within educational campuses.

Objectives -
1. To classify waste into Paper, Plastic, Organic, and Hazardous
2. To encourage correct waste disposal using bin color guidance
3. To spread environmental awareness through AI-generated facts
4. To support sustainable campus initiatives

Features -
1. Real-time waste capture using webcam (Streamlit camera)
2. Deep learning image classification (TensorFlow/Keras)
3. Waste categories with clear labels
4. Bin color recommendations
5. AI-generated environmental impact facts (Gemini API)
6. Simple and interactive web interface

Technologies Used -
1. Python
2. Streamlit
3. TensorFlow / Keras
4. NumPy
5. Pillow (PIL)
6. Google Gemini API
7. Git & GitHub

Steps followed in the project - 
1. Identified the Problem : Observed improper waste segregation on campus and the need for an easy, awareness-driven solution.
2. Defined the Objective : Planned to build a system that classifies waste and guides users to the correct disposal bin.
3. Collected & Prepared Data : Used labeled waste images to train a machine learning model for classification.
4. Built the ML Model : Trained an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras.
5. Saved the Trained Model : Exported the trained model as keras_model.h5 for reuse in the application.
7. Integrated the Model : Connected the trained model to the Streamlit app to predict waste type from images.
8. Added AI Assistance : Integrated Google Gemini API to suggest bin color and provide environmental impact facts.
9. Tested the Application : Tested the system with different waste items to check accuracy and performance.
10. Version Control & Deployment : Used Git and GitHub to manage code and prepare the project for submission.
